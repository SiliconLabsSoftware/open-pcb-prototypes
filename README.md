# SiliconLabs Open PCB Prototypes

## Introduction

This repository aims to deliver easy-to-manufacture prototyping boards, which enable you to integrate Silabs radio modules and chips into your ecosystems. These prototyping boards serve as an intermediate hardware layer between Silabs wireless modules and your end-devices. By the designed PCBs, you can easily test our [application examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/application_examples) and build new radio solution with our wireless technologies.
